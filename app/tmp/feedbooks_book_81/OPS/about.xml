<p>Charles John Huffam Dickens pen-name "Boz", was the foremost
English novelist of the Victorian era, as well as a vigorous social
campaigner. Considered one of the English language's greatest
writers, he was acclaimed for his rich storytelling and memorable
characters, and achieved massive worldwide popularity in his
lifetime. Later critics, beginning with George Gissing and G. K.
Chesterton, championed his mastery of prose, his endless invention
of memorable characters and his powerful social sensibilities. Yet
he has also received criticism from writers such as George Henry
Lewes, Henry James, and Virginia Woolf, who list sentimentality,
implausible occurrence and grotesque characters as faults in his
oeuvre. The popularity of Dickens' novels and short stories has
meant that none have ever gone out of print. Dickens wrote
serialised novels, which was the usual format for fiction at the
time, and each new part of his stories would be eagerly anticipated
by the reading public. Source: Wikipedia</p>
